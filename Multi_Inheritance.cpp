Object: Multi - Inheritance

Multi - Inheritance ::

is property to inherent from differet parent classes
(c++) can do multi_inheritance but java,c# can't
(java)(C#) can use interface to implment multi_inheritance

when to use?

it is useful when you don't want to create an instance of an object but want to execute some function on it
(by using static functions, we don't have to depend on any entities)
it can be used as interface in C++
